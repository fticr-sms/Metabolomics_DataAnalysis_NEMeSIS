    "This notebook provides a template for standard metabolomics data analysis whether or not you already annoted your data with names and/or chemical formulas with other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to annotate, treat, see common and exclusive metabolites, perform multivariate unsupervised and supervised statistical analysis, univariate statistical analysis, produce Van Krevelen diagrams, Kendrick Mass Defect plots and chemical composition series. It also has compound finders that allow you to search for specific compounds using their names, chemical formulas, _m/z_'s or neutral masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wide variety of data pre-treatments is provided with easily customizable functions and instructions to do that are provided.\n",

    "**Warning**: Reading files is very dependent on the format of the file, you'll have to see and adapt that part and not just press run all on the notebook.\n",

    "## Metabolic Feature Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs Data Filtering through a succession of 4 different stages, each with their own purpose and objective. Many of these stages include multiple options. Individual stages can be skipped, and we may even recommend skipping some of them depending on the type of data you are utilizing. The output of the cell is the filtered dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage (and options within each) are now presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Filtering based on the number of samples each feature appears in. basic_filt: 'total_samples' (_default_), 'class_samples', None.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This will only include features that appear in a determined number or percentage (`n_min_samples_feature_appear` parameter) of either the total samples of the dataset or of at least the samples of one class. (Filter experimental artifacts, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Filtering based on intensity values. int_based_filter: True or False.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This will filter metabolic features based on their intensity values as calculated by the `mean` or `median` over the samples they appear in (selected by `intensity_calculation`), removing lower intensity features. The `int_threshold_type` parameter determines whether a hard threshold with a set intensity value is used ('Intensity value') or a percentage based threshold where the lowest intensity X % of features are removed ('% Based'). The intensity value or percentage thresholds are set using the parameter `int_threshold_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Filtering based on the feature variance of Quality Control samples. QC_filter: True or False.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only available if you have at least three QC samples as selected in _qc_sample_cols_. This will eliminate features that have a variance in the quality control samples (where they should be equal) as estimated by the relative standard deviation (standard deviation / mean) above a determined threshold, since that points that they are not reproducible. The threshold is controlled by the `rsd_threshold` parameter (initially set up to 0.2). Features that do not appear in the QC samples are assumed to have 0 variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Filtering based on the feature variance of analysed samples. var_based_filter: True or False.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This filtering is not recommended if you are looking for exclusive metabolic features in the classes of your datasets or if you aim to use feature occurrence data. It will filter out the lowest variance features across the samples since their intensity patterns would not be informative. The ways to calculate variance allowed and selected by the `variance_calculation_type` parameter are: 'Inter-Quartile Range', 'Standard Deviation' (std), 'Relative Standard Deviation' (std/mean), 'Median Absolute Deviation' (MAD) and 'Relative Median Absolute Deviation' (MAD/mean). The percentage of features with lowest variance to remove is set in `feat_to_remove_percent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have a reference feature in your data, filtering may remove it, especially at stage 4. Use the parameter `always_keep_feat` to select indexes in a list that you want to preserve even if they would be filtered out. After filtering they are re-added to the data (if they would be removed by the filtering, they are put in the end of the DataFrame; if not, they are kept where they originally are).**"

    "\n",
    "**Back to [Table of Contents](#toc)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the proximity of some m/z peaks, they can have the same exact compound annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section merges peaks that have the same compound annotation on the different databases into one single peak. Usually there is one peak that is the 'main' one with much higher intensities across the samples, although some cases this does not happen with the two _m/z_ peaks have or the annotation comes from multiple adducts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however a lot of problems in this process. In general, our procedure is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) See peaks that have the same metabolite annotation by a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) See if the other compound annotations do not have different annotations for those peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) If not, save the meta data of the compound and formula annotations by the different databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Situation Trouble - If yes, then we may have a problem. If for example, HMDB puts two different compounds for the 2 _m/z_ peaks and LOTUS puts the same compound, it is fair to treat them as different peaks. HOWEVER, if there are more than two peaks assigned with the same formula, the following can happen. Let's imagine a scenario where HMDB puts the same compound for 4 _m/z_ peaks and LOTUS assigns to one of them one compound, to a second one a different compound and the last two ones does not assign a compound. What is the correct course of action? Right now, it just does not merge any of these peaks, but we could merge the two peaks that do not have an annotation by LOTUS. Would that be correct? Or should we merge with one of the two other peaks which have annotations by LOTUS. After all, they would normally be merged if not for the existence of two different LOTUS annotations. Hence, the problem and why we advocate against using multiple databases at once.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Then create the new peak, by keeping the highest intensity value in each sample from the different peaks if they belong to the same adducts (intensity values come from the maximum value in the peak and not peak area) and summing the intensities of the peaks if they belong to different adducts. If both cases simultaneously happen for an annotation, same adduct peaks are first merged by keeping the highest intensity and then summing the intensities of peaks from different adducts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1) If peaks come from different adducts based on the Probable _m/z_ column, then, the peak 'bucket label' and 'Neutral Mass'/'Probable _m/z_' columns become identical to the peak which has the highest average intensity of all the peaks with the same annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2) If the peaks are all from the same adduct and all highest intensity values come from one _m/z_ peak, then the 'bucket label' and 'Neutral Mass'/'Probable _m/z_' columns become identical to that peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3) If the peaks are all from the same adduct and the highest intensity comes from at least two different peaks, then, the peak 'bucket label', 'Neutral Mass' or 'Probable _m/z_' columns become the weighted average (based on the average intensity of the peaks) of all the peaks with the same annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) This process is repeated for all annotations and then formula assignment. **Usually the number of de-duplications made by each database should decrease since when you de-duplciate duplicate assignments by one database, you are usually de-duplicating in others.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALWAYS check the merge_problems variable. If it is NOT empty, then those merge problems issues might exist. We do not currently have an automatic answer for them. They should be seen on a case by case basis.**"
